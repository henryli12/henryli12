### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @henryli12
I'm a software developer at Epic Systems, where I build Clinical Decision Support tools that help clinicians make better, data-driven decisions. I work across the full stack using technologies like C#, React.js, Python, and MUMPS. My work includes UI revamps, effectiveness optimization, and analytical tools used by thousands of end-users. Iâ€™m passionate about writing clean, reliable code and creating software that solves real-world problems.
